#  Getting Started with Supabase


##  Initialize the Client

> The Supabase client is your entrypoint to the rest of the Supabase functionality and is the easiest way to interact with everything we offer within the Supabase ecosystem.

You need your unique Supabase URL and Key which are supplied when you create a new project in your project dashboard:

```swift
let supabase = SupabaseClient(
    supabaseURL: URL(string: "https://xyzcompany.supabase.co")!,
    supabaseKey: "public-anon-key",
)
```
